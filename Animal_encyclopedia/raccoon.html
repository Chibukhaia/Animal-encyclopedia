			<a href="images/Raccoon.jpeg">Raccoon</a> also spelled racoon[3] and sometimes called the common raccoon to
            distinguish it from other species, is a mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid
            family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb).
            Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the
            raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed
            tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal.
            The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks
            for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates,
            33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.
