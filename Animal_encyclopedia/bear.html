			<a href="images/bear.jpeg">Bear</a> is a large, carnivorous mammal found in North America, Europe, and Asia.
		There are several species of bears, including the brown bear, black bear, and polar bear.
		Bears are known for their strength, intelligence, and fierce protectiveness of their young.
		They can weigh up to <strong>1,500 pounds</strong> and stand up to 10 feet tall on their hind legs.
			Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
			Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of
			habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere.
			Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
			Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts,
			small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
