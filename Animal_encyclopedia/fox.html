			<a href="images/Fox.jpeg">Foxes</a>  small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera
            of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed,
            slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). Twelve species belong to the monophyletic
            <strong>"true foxes"</strong> of genus Vulpes. Approximately another <strong> 25 current or extinct species </strong>
            are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of
            the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox,
            and island fox. Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species
            of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution
            of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence
            in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of
            hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European
            settlers to various parts of the New World.
